# Discriminant-Analysis
developing LDA and QDA models for raisin_dataset.csv 
dataset and evaluate its effectiveness. The dataset has 900 observations and 8 
variables: 
Independent Variables 
Area: Gives the number of pixels within the boundaries of the raisin.  
Perimeter: It measures the environment by calculating the distance between the boundaries of the raisin 
and the pixels around it.  
MajorAxisLength: Gives the length of the main axis, which is the longest line that can be drawn on the 
raisin.  
MinorAxisLength: Gives the length of the small axis, which is the shortest line that can be drawn on 
the raisin.  
Eccentricity: It gives a measure of the eccentricity of the ellipse, which has the same moments as 
raisins.  
ConvexArea: Gives the number of pixels of the smallest convex shell of the region formed by the raisin.  
Extent: Gives the ratio of the region formed by the raisin to the total pixels in the bounding box.  

Dependent Variable 
Class: Kecimen and Besni raisin.
